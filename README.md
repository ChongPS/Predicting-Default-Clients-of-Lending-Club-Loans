# Predicting-Default-Clients-of-Lending-Club-Loans

**Data**:
I will work with the publicly available Lending Club data from Kaggle. The raw data contains 150 fields for each loan
originated. https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

**Objective**:
My goal is to build a predictive model that can predict the loan status (whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off) and prevent loan default, since it will result in a loss of both principal and interest to the company. I also attempt to find the most important factors in making decisions (lend it or not), to minimize the risks of loan defaults for the company and to help the potential borrowers to maximize the possibility of getting a loan. 

**Results**:
