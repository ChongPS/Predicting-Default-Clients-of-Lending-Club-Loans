Data:
I will work with the publicly available Lending Club data on Kaggle. The raw data contains 150 fields for each loan
originated. https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can predict the loan status (whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off), since a loan default will result in a loss of both principal and interest.

I also attempt to find the most important factors that affect the result (lend it or not), to minimize the risks of defaults loans for the company and to help the potential borrowers to maximize the possibility of getting a loan.
