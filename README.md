Data:
I will work with the publicly available Lending Club data on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can predict the loan status (whether or not a loan will be fully paid or charged off) and interpret the results to find the factors which affect the result.
